How to use the HLS scripts
1. Make the shell script executable:
```bash
chmod +x hls/script/run_hls.sh
```

2. Run the complete HLS flow
```bash
cd hardware/hls/script

# Basic build (synthesis + IP export)
./run_hls.sh

# Clean build with co-simulation
./run_hls.sh --clean --cosim

# Or run directly with Vitis HLS
vitis_hls -f build_all.tcl
```

3. Individual script usage
```tcl
# Create projects only
vitis_hls -f create_project.tcl

# Run synthesis only
vitis_hls -f run_synthesis.tcl

# Run co-simulation only
vitis_hls -f run_cosim.tcl

# Export IP only
vitis_hls -f export_ip.tcl
```

4. Integration with Vivado:
After running the scripts, the generated IP cores will be in hardware/ip/custom_ip/.
To use them in Vivado:
 - Open your Vivado project
 - Go to Settings → Repository → IP Repository
 - Add the path to hardware/ip/custom_ip/
 - The HLS IP cores will appear in the IP catalog
